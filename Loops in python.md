Absolutely! Let's dive into **loops** in Python. Loops allow you to **repeat a block of code** multiple times without having to write the same code over and over again. There are two main types of loops in Python: the **for loop** and the **while loop**.

### 1. **For Loop**
A **for loop** is used to **iterate** over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.) or a range of numbers. It is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat the action.

#### Syntax:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute
```

- `variable`: A temporary variable that takes each value from the sequence one by one.
- `sequence`: A collection like a list, tuple, string, or range.

### **Example of a For Loop**:
Let's say we have a list of fruits and want to print each fruit.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### Output:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

In this example, the `for` loop goes through each item in the list `fruits` and prints it.

---

### **For Loop with Range()**
You can use the `range()` function to loop over a sequence of numbers. This is useful when you don't have a sequence like a list or string but want to repeat an action a certain number of times.

#### Syntax:
```python
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code to execute
```
- `start`: The value where the loop starts (default is 0).
- `stop`: The value where the loop stops (but does not include this number).
- `step`: The amount by which the value increases (default is 1).

#### Example: Loop from 1 to 5
```python
for i in range(1, 6):  # Loop from 1 to 5
    print(i)
```

#### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example, the loop runs 5 times, printing the values 1 through 5.

---

### 2. **While Loop**
A **while loop** repeats as long as a certain condition is **True**. It is used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run and you want to repeat it until a condition is met.

#### Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute
```

- `condition`: An expression that returns `True` or `False`. The loop will keep running as long as the condition is `True`.

---

### **Example of a While Loop**:
Let’s say we want to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1  # Increment the value of i
```

#### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

In this example:
- The condition is `i <= 5`. The loop will keep running as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5.
- We need to **increment** `i` inside the loop using `i += 1`, so that the condition will eventually become `False` and the loop will stop.

---

### 3. **Breaking Out of a Loop**
Sometimes, you might want to stop the loop before it has finished all iterations. You can do that using the `break` statement. This will immediately exit the loop.

#### Example: Break the loop when `i` equals 3.
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break  # Exit the loop when i equals 3
    print(i)
```

#### Output:
```
1
2
```

In this example, when `i` becomes 3, the `break` statement stops the loop and prevents it from continuing to 4 and 5.

---

### 4. **Skipping an Iteration**
If you want to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one, you can use the `continue` statement.

#### Example: Skip when `i` equals 3.
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip the iteration when i equals 3
    print(i)
```

#### Output:
```
1
2
4
5
```

In this example, when `i` equals 3, the `continue` statement skips printing `3` and moves on to the next iteration.

---

### 5. **Nested Loops**
You can also use **nested loops**, which means having one loop inside another. This is useful when you need to iterate over a collection of collections (like a list of lists).

#### Example: Nested For Loop
Let’s say we have a list of lists and want to print all the elements.

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item)
```

#### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

In this example:
- The outer loop iterates over each sublist (`row`), and the inner loop iterates over the items in each row.

---

### 6. **Summary of Loops:**
- **For loop**: Used when you know the number of iterations or are iterating over a sequence (like a list or range).
- **While loop**: Used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance and need to repeat until a condition is met.
- **Break**: Used to exit a loop before it finishes all iterations.
- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
- **Nested loops**: A loop inside another loop to iterate over collections of collections.

---

### Recap with Examples:
1. **For loop with list**:
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```

2. **For loop with range()**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       print(i)
   ```

3. **While loop**:
   ```python
   i = 1
   while i <= 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1
   ```

4. **Break in loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       if i == 3:
           break
       print(i)
   ```

5. **Continue in loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       if i == 3:
           continue
       print(i)
   ```
