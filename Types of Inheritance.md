Let's modify the post to include an explanation of **Inheritance Types** in Python. Inheritance in object-oriented programming can be classified into different types based on how classes are related.

### Inheritance Types

There are primarily **5 types of inheritance** in object-oriented programming:

1. **Single Inheritance**  
2. **Multiple Inheritance**  
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**  
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

Let's explain each type with examples and a diagram.

### 1. **Single Inheritance**
In **Single Inheritance**, a child class inherits from one parent class.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")
        
dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Inherited method from Animal class
dog.bark()   # Method of Dog class
```

#### Output:
```
Animal speaks
Dog barks
```

In this example, `Dog` is inheriting from `Animal`.

---

### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**
In **Multiple Inheritance**, a child class can inherit from more than one parent class.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird flies")

class Bat(Animal, Bird):  # Bat inherits from both Animal and Bird
    pass

bat = Bat()
bat.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
bat.fly()    # Inherited from Bird
```

#### Output:
```
Animal speaks
Bird flies
```

In this case, the `Bat` class is inheriting from both `Animal` and `Bird`.

---

### 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
In **Multilevel Inheritance**, a child class becomes the parent class for another child class, forming a "chain" of inheritance.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Puppy(Dog):  # Puppy inherits from Dog, which in turn inherits from Animal
    def play(self):
        print("Puppy plays")

puppy = Puppy()
puppy.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
puppy.bark()   # Inherited from Dog
puppy.play()   # Method of Puppy
```

#### Output:
```
Animal speaks
Dog barks
Puppy plays
```

In this example, `Puppy` inherits from `Dog`, which inherits from `Animal`.

---

### 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
In **Hierarchical Inheritance**, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

class Cat(Animal):  # Cat inherits from Animal
    def meow(self):
        print("Cat meows")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
dog.bark()   # Method of Dog

cat = Cat()
cat.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
cat.meow()   # Method of Cat
```

#### Output:
```
Animal speaks
Dog barks
Animal speaks
Cat meows
```

Here, both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from the same parent class `Animal`.

---

### 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**
**Hybrid Inheritance** is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. It can be a mix of any of the inheritance types mentioned above.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird flies")

class Bat(Animal, Bird):  # Bat inherits from both Animal and Bird
    pass

class FlyingDog(Bat):  # FlyingDog inherits from Bat, which is a mix of Animal and Bird
    def bark(self):
        print("FlyingDog barks")

flying_dog = FlyingDog()
flying_dog.speak()  # Inherited from Animal
flying_dog.fly()    # Inherited from Bird
flying_dog.bark()   # Method of FlyingDog
```

#### Output:
```
Animal speaks
Bird flies
FlyingDog barks
```

In this example, `FlyingDog` inherits from `Bat`, which itself inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`.

### Inheritance Types in a Table:

| Inheritance Type        | Description                                                                                         | Example                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Inheritance**   | A child class inherits from only one parent class.                                                   | `Dog` inherits from `Animal`                                                            |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | A child class inherits from more than one parent class.                                              | `Bat` inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`                                             |
| **Multilevel Inheritance**| A child class inherits from a parent class, and that parent class is inherited by another class.   | `Puppy` inherits from `Dog`, and `Dog` inherits from `Animal`                           |
| **Hierarchical Inheritance** | Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.                                           | `Dog` and `Cat` both inherit from `Animal`                                              |
| **Hybrid Inheritance**   | A combination of two or more inheritance types.                                                    | `FlyingDog` inherits from `Bat` (which inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`)           |

### Inheritance Diagram:

```plaintext
          Animal
         /      \
      Dog        Cat
     /
  Puppy
```
- **Single Inheritance**: `Puppy` inherits from `Dog`, and `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: `Bat` inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: `Puppy` inherits from `Dog`, and `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal`.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: `FlyingDog` inherits from `Bat`, which inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`.

### Summary:
- **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from another.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: One class inherits from more than one class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A chain of inheritance where one class inherits from another, and so on.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from one parent class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: A mix of different types of inheritance.

These inheritance types help in organizing and reusing code in different ways. Understanding these concepts is essential in OOP to write efficient and modular code!
