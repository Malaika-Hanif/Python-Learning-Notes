 Let’s start with the basics of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. DSA is a critical part of computer science and programming. Understanding them helps in solving complex problems efficiently. We’ll go over essential concepts and their applications.

### 1. **What is a Data Structure?**
A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**

### 2. **What is an Algorithm?**
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. Algorithms are essential for processing data stored in data structures.

### 3. **Basic Data Structures**

#### 3.1 **Array**
- An array is a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by an index or key.
- Arrays have fixed sizes, meaning the number of elements cannot be changed once defined.

#### Example:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1 (first element)
```

#### 3.2 **Linked List**
- A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements (nodes) are stored with references (pointers) to the next node.
- There are different types of linked lists: **Singly Linked List** and **Doubly Linked List**.

#### Example (Singly Linked List):
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node

# Creating and appending nodes
ll = LinkedList()
ll.append(1)
ll.append(2)
ll.append(3)
```

### 4. **Advanced Data Structures**

#### 4.1 **Stack**
- A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
- Operations: **push** (add), **pop** (remove), and **peek** (view the top element).

#### Example:
```python
stack = []
stack.append(1)  # push
stack.append(2)  # push
stack.append(3)  # push
print(stack.pop())  # pop -> Output: 3
```

#### 4.2 **Queue**
- A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.
- Operations: **enqueue** (add), **dequeue** (remove), and **peek** (view the front element).

#### Example:
```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append(1)  # enqueue
queue.append(2)  # enqueue
queue.append(3)  # enqueue
print(queue.popleft())  # dequeue -> Output: 1
```

#### 4.3 **Tree**
- A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
- Common types of trees: **Binary Tree**, **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, and **Heaps**.

#### Example (Binary Tree):
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.value = key

root = Node(10)
root.left = Node(20)
root.right = Node(30)
```

### 5. **Algorithms**

#### 5.1 **Sorting Algorithms**
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order, usually in ascending or descending order.

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part. Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Selects a "pivot" element, partitions the array around the pivot, and sorts recursively.

#### Example (Bubble Sort):
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]  # Swap

arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

#### 5.2 **Searching Algorithms**
Searching algorithms are used to find an element in a data structure.

- **Linear Search**: Checks each element in the list sequentially until the target is found.
- **Binary Search**: Used on **sorted arrays**, it repeatedly divides the search interval in half.

#### Example (Binary Search):
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = binary_search(arr, 4)
print("Element found at index:", result)
```

### 6. **Time and Space Complexity**
When discussing algorithms, we also need to consider their efficiency in terms of **time** and **space**.

- **Big O Notation** describes the time complexity and space complexity of an algorithm.
    - **O(1)**: Constant time
    - **O(n)**: Linear time
    - **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
    - **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time

### 7. **DSA Concepts in a Table:**

| **Data Structure** | **Description**                                          | **Example**               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Array**          | A collection of elements, stored in contiguous memory.   | `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`      |
| **Linked List**    | A collection of nodes, where each node points to the next. | `Node -> Node -> Node`    |
| **Stack**          | Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).                       | `stack = [1, 2, 3]`       |
| **Queue**          | Follows FIFO (First In, First Out).                      | `queue = [1, 2, 3]`       |
| **Tree**           | Hierarchical data structure with nodes.                  | `root = Node(10)`         |
| **Graph**          | A collection of nodes connected by edges.                | `Graph = {1: [2, 3], 2: [4]}` |

| **Binary Search**    | O(log n)                   | O(log n)                    |
